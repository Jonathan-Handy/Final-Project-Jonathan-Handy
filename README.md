# Final Project Jonathan Handy
In this project we were given a template of a simulation of video game character logic and required to modify it for multiple units per team and to add a critical/lucky roll system for the attack, defense, and healing. This project is written in C++ using Visual Studio and was the final project for my Tech Applications  using Programming Languages university course
